# Linear_Regression

Regression is all about exploring a relationship between two or more variables, and identifying how strong the relationship is. Linear Regression, as the name tells is to make a linear model, modelling the relationship. Output or the dependent variable is supposed to be a scalar value, whereas the independent or explanatory variables can be scalar or categorical.

Linear Regression with one independent variable is often known as 'Simple Linear Regression' whereas the case where independent variables are more than one is known as 'Multilinear / Multiple Linear Regression'.

It's important to understand the assumptions of Linear Regression. This tutorial will help us to understand the assumptions and we will try to build a linear regression model with a dataset taken from kaggle and then we will try to validate the assumptions.

### Dataset:

#### Columns:

age: age of primary beneficiary

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

smoker: Smoking

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

#### Aim: Predict medical charges (can be also be treated as insurance costs)
